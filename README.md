This approach improves the CPU Performance in real time OS. The given problem is priority based Round robin CPU Scheduling algorithm. It has the same property of round robin and fixed priority with an advantage of reducing starvation and integrates priority-based scheduling. This code or algorithm improves all the drawbacks like varying time quantum, average waiting time, Turnaround time and number of context switches.  This code implements multilevel Feedback Queue in two levels.  Level 1: Fixed Priority Pre-emptive Scheduling  Level 2: Round Robin Scheduling
